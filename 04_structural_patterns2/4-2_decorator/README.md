# Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator design pattern is very simple, but it offers many benefits in legacy code.
For example, you can decorate an old field with a new one by putting the types used in legacy code into decorators, like Russian dolls.

## Objectives

- When you need to add functionality to some code that you don't have access to, or you don't want to modify to avoid a negative effect on the code, and follow the open/close principle (like legacy code)
- When you want the functionality of an object to be created or altered dynamically, and the number of features is unknown and could grow fast
