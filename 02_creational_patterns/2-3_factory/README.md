# Factory method pattern

delegating the creation of different types of payments

## Objectives

- Delegating the creation of new instances of structures to a different part of the program
- Working at the interface level instead of with concrete implementations
- Grouping families of objects to obtain a family object creator

## For example

The trip agency represents a Factory of trips.
You don't deal with hotels and traveling and you just tell the agency the destination you are interested in so that they provide you with everything you need.
