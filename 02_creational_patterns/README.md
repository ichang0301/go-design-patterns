# Creational Patterns

They are all non-thread safe!

## Why to use

Mainly, creational patterns **try to give ready-to-use objects to users** instead of asking for their creation, which, in some cases, could be complex, or which would couple your code with the concrete implementations of the functionality that should be defined in an interface.

The five main creational design patterns' purpose is to abstract the user from the creation of objects for complexity or maintainability purposes.
