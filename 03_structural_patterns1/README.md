## Composite design pattern

It is a `has a` relationship. It is different from inheritance (`is a` relationship).

The adapter pattern can help us make two incompatible interfaces work together by using an `Adapter` object in between.

## Bridge design pattern

The bridge pattern allow us to create swapping structures with complete reusability between objects and their implementations.
