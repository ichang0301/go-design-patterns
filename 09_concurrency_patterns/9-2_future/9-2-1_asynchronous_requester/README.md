# 9-2-1_simple_asynchronous_requester

## Acceptance criteria

We don't have functional requirements for this task.
Instead, we will have technical requirements for it.

- Delegate the function execution to a different Goroutine
- The function will return a string (maybe) or an error
- The handlers must be already defined before executing the function
- The design must be reusable
