# 3-1-1_direct_composition

## Requirements and acceptance criteria

- We must have an `Athlete` struct with a `Train` method
- We must have a `Swimmer` with a `Swim` method
- We must have an `Animal` struct with an `Eat` method
- We must have a `Fish` struct with a `Swim` method that is shared with the `Swimmer`, and not have inheritance or hierarchy issues

## Why is there no test?

It doesn't have much to test apart from the structure itself.
We won't write unit tests, and we'll simply describe the ways to create those compositions in Go.
