# Composite design pattern

The composite design pattern favours composition (commonly defined as a `has a` relationship) over inheritance (an `is a` relationship).
All in all, Go doesn't have inheritance because it doesn't need it.

## Objectives

The objective of the composition is to avoid hierarchy hell where the complexity of an application could grow too much, and the clarity of the code is affected.

## Two types of composition

- the `direct` composition
- the `embedding` composition
