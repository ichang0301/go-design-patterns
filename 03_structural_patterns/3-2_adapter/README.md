# Adapter design pattern

The adapter pattern is very useful when:

- an interface gets outdated and it's not possible to replace it easily or fast
- maintaining the open/closed principle (open to new functionality, but closed to modifications) in our apps, making them more predictable too

## Objectives

Two interfaces that are incompatible, but which must work together, are good candidates for an adapter pattern (but they could also use the facade pattern(c.f. 4-3_facade), for example)
